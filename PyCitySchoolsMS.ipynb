    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "- It can strongly be inferred that students attending charter schools (as opposed to district schools) achieved much higher test scores across the board, especially math. In turn, this led to a higher overall passing rate for charter schools (90.43%) which is close to double that of district schools (53.67%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting find within the analysis of this dataset is the seemingly negative correlation between spending per student and the percent of students who are passing. As spending ranges (per student) decrease, the percent of students passing increase and vice versa. This trend can also be seen with school budget; as budget increases the percent of students passing decreases.\n",
